    <p>Apple is a prominent hardware and software company best known for its series of personal computers, the iPod and
        its innovative marketing strategies for its products.

        Introduced in 1984, the Macintosh was the first widely sold personal computer with a graphical user interface
        (GUI). That feature and others -- such as an improved floppy drive design and a low-cost hard drive that made
        data retrieval faster and more reliable -- helped Apple cultivate a reputation for innovation, which the company
        still enjoys today. The Apple headquarters are located in Capering, CA, at 1-5 Infinite Loop. Apple borrowed
        the name for the circular road around their office buildings from programming, where an infinite loop is the
        term for a code sequence lacking a functional exit.</p>
